/**
 * The app shell.
 *
 * Routing is a plain state switch over `store.view` — no react-router. Every
 * member of the `View` union is mapped to a screen below, so no link, nav item
 * or persona switch can land on a route that does not exist; anything the union
 * does not cover falls through to the 404.
 *
 * The chrome — both shells, the dock, the toasts, the check-in sheet, the cancel
 * confirm and the calendar's night drill-in — is mounted once around the switch,
 * so a view change never remounts it and a toast survives the navigation that
 * raised it.
